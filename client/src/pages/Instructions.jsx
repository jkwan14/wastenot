        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Join or create a household - Start by creating a household or joining an existing one using an invite ID. This lets you share your food items with anyone in your home.</li>
            <li>Add your food items — Enter groceries you’ve purchased, along with the category (Pantry or Fridge/Freezer) and an expiration date. Not sure when it expires? Use our suggested shelf life guide for a quick estimate.</li>
            <li>Sort your items — View and organize your list by expiration date or name so you can quickly see what’s freshest (and what needs to be used soon).</li>
            <li>Get notified — We’ll send you a notification when an item is two days from expiring. You can view all notifications in the bell icon at the top right.</li>
            <li>Generate recipes — Select ingredients you want to use up and hit “Generate Recipe” at the bottom of the page. We'll suggest recipe ideas to reduce waste.</li>
            <li>Save your favorites — Love a recipe? Hit the heart icon to save it for next time.</li>
            <li>Expired food? — Use the menu to find compost drop-off locations near you.</li>
            <li>Manage your household - Head to the menu to view your household name, see other members, and update your membership as needed.</li>
