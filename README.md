# Project Title

WasteNot - An app to help reduce food waste in every kitchen

## Description

Our app is inspired by one simple principle - we hate food waste! It is estimated that food waste accounts for 30%-40% of the Unite States food supply. Of that, almost half is thrown away in our own homes. Not only is this a huge waste of resources (one pound of food waste per person per day), it's also expensive (about $700 per person each year)! WasteNot provides a simple solution to help combat this problem - keep track of all your food items in one location, monitor their expiration dates, and get recipes for ingredients you need to use soon. If a food item is no longer edible, WasteNot also provides helpful tips for composting at home or finding a composting location near you. By making the process easy and accessible to all users, we hope that we can make a dent in this pressing global issue.
